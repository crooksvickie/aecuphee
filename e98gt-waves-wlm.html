There is a Short time measurement in the dial preset from 400ms to 2min - wondering what the Netflix spec requires. Couldn't find anything in their documentati. 1. Устанавливаем Waves V9R30 2.

Waves WLM: A quick start guide to using WLM Plus, the loudness metering and correction plugin for broadcast, film, games, video content creators  I just recently switched to Ableton from Logic Pro X which had a great in the box metering plugin that measured LUFS average, short term, etc but Ableton has nothing close. I have tried Izotope's Insight which I found to be pretty CPU intensive but the WLM doesn't seem to bog down my CPU when I slap it at the end of my master chain to check my LUFS. I would highly recommend for anyone that struggles with having a good metering plugin that doesn't hog those valuable CPUs. The Waves sale applies. Only at Sweetwater!

Wondering if you guys use it or a similar meter for your post applications. If so, can you explain your process to get your measurements withing +/- 2dB of -24 LKFS? At what point do you start referring to the meter -- the whole time, while using master bus compression? Also, can someone explain to me a little bit about how the LKFS measurement works in terms of dialogue? I know LKFS is a long-term measurement Thanks, Ian. that helps a good bit. I wish the meter manufacturers were making recommendations similar to yours. The meter you used in the video had adjustable thresholds, but most of the cheaper/free ones don’t, and working in the -12 to -10 range is squarely in the red on the meters.

Waves WLM Plus Loudness Meter Overview The WLM Plus Loudness Meter from Waves is a plug-in that provides precision loudness. When I first joined this sub I caught a bit of flack for my newbie post asking how to achieve commercial loudness levels without sounding squashed.

Following on from Russ's show & tell review of the new Waves Scheps 73 EQ, Mike takes a look at the other plug-in Waves have just released the WLM Plus. I have been making music for some time now and I'm quite fascinated by dynamic range. In the past, I used a number of plugins and tools (e.g. TT Dynamic Range Meter, Waves WLM Plus and the Jiixyj Loudness Scanner) but all of them measure Loudness Range instead of Dynamic Range. I'm trying to decide between getting Youlean Loudness Meter Pro (at ) or Dynameter (at ). Both seem to have a dynamic range graph and both have great reviews. Youlean has a demo which, unfortunately, misses Waves 最新バージョンのご案内 V10およびWaves Central 10.0.1.3.

Having mixed mainly for broadcast at R128 spec in a 79dB calibrated 5.1 room a client asked me to mix a cinema commercial\ with the following specs: \- Max 85LEQ(m) \- TP -8dB \- No comression So, the 1st thing I needed to know, did I need anyting new so I could measure the LEQ(m). I had both Nugen VISLM2 and Waves WLM plus. So that was the simple part. And then the hard part. With my 1st mix I just couldn't reach anything higher than 76 as what I thought sounded familiar 
So I'm mixing and mastering a friend's rock project (they got a bluesy, funky sound), and I've finished the mixes and am moving on to mastering, but I have some questions regarding how to maintain a good level of dynamic range. I've gotten the opportunity to try out the Waves WLM meter, and I ran my mixes through them and found that the dynamic range on the tracks are 5-8 loudness units. My questions is if this is already a little too squashed. I did volume riding with the trim plugin placed.

Should I aim for something like -12db across the board? After I get that sorted what do you guys suggest for mastering the whole thing? I'm not really confident doing it myself. Is it just a matter of putting a limiter on or should I get someone else to do it if I'm not sure? Thanks for any advice.
